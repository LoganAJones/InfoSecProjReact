# InfoSecProj


## Goals
We hope to create a fresh, simple dashboard that contains:
- A welcome message
- A concise collection of cybersecurity-related news
- A cybersecurity tip of the day

Our page will be specifically designed not to overwhelm users or to trick them into reading too many articles. We expect to complete a minimalist, simple dashboard that feels comforting and satisfying to navigate
